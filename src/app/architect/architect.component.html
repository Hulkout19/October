                “Oh I see now what you mean, mmhmm.” The man starts to exclaim, but ends in a kind of mutter, indicating quite the opposite of his words. “But where will the- oh.” He starts to ask but cuts off when the Designer sweeps yet another set of blueprints off of the cherry-oak table, and into the aluminum trash can patiently waiting alongside. The Designer points to the table, where a set of Blueprints, slightly crumpled and yellowed with age lay still. “Oh what? Yes, well, good, let’s do it that way then, you are the Qualified One so yes, right on.” The Designer begins to put His hand on the Prints, but His flesh and the Old Blueprints are interrupted by another sheet of blueprints swept in between them, halting their supposed meeting momentarily. The Designer looks at the man with familiarity, and tired, yet not disappointed eyes. 

            </p>

            <p>
                “Well you see, I’ve had a look at Your Plans and Oh! How wonderful they are! They are genius, almost like You have done this before! You are a credit to Your work, no doubt! They are all laid out beautifully, oh what wonderful Measurements! You have thought of everything, there is nothing I would change, nothing at all! To take away from it would make Your Plans void, to add to them, oh would throw them off completely! No no, they are beautiful and perfect! I have heard of You from others and I see so much better than even what they saw!” The Designer smiles. 
            </p>

            <p >
                And with a questioning glance, indicates the plans now separating His touch from His Own. “Ah well, you see, as I have said I have heard of you from others! Others have raved about Your Plans, absolutely raved! And success, oh such success! But well, perhaps, this is my current thought, that maybe, if You, and of course I am not adding or taking away, but perhaps well, You forgot about this?” And with his final syllable the man directs the attention of the Designer to a figure in the upper right corner of the main diagram. “You see, in Your Original Plans, well, You did not include this particular feature, and well, clearly it is lacking! It would be so very comfortable here, we could add some velvet here, and look! Right here is a place where we could advertise Your work! It would be perfect! Anyone who interacts would see Your name and know it is Your work, and You know what that means for business! Are You paying attention?” It was at some point around the first mention of advertisement that the Designer had walked over to a bookcase, floor to ceiling, browsed a section of tan folders on the third shelf from the top, and was now returning with two of these in hand, which He placed gently on the table next to the man’s masterpiece of blueprints. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Designer opens the top folder, and flips through several sheets of blueprints nearly identical in style to the ones atop the table, but miniaturized, and currently housed in clear plastic pockets for protection. Of these, He selects three prints, lays them on the table, and then repeats the process with the second folder. “And what are these? No, they don’t look particularly familiar.” The man replies to the Designers gesture slightly evasively, not wanting to admit where he had seen them before. In response, the Designer thumbs through the six of them, revealing the names enclosed in a small black-border box at the top left of each of the prints. Sally, Laurie, Dan, Stig, Maryanne, Bill- as He points to each one, the man hesitates, and nods slightly, not looking the Designer in the eyes, which never leave the man’s face. 
            </p>

            <p >
                “Yes, yes, alright! Those, I suppose, are the names of the friends that told me to come to you! I don’t really see what this has to do with-” The Designer puts the first print next to the blueprint currently blocking His own, indicating first the upper right corner of the main diagram on the man’s plans, and then the corresponding location on the smaller print (Sally’s). “Well yes, it’s not there, but-” Laurie’s. “Again, You are correct but then again-” Dan’s. Stig’s. Maryanne’s. Bill’s. The man looks first at his own plans and then back at the pile of smaller ones next to them and finally gives out a sigh. “Yes yes, I see Your point. None of them include the feature I have thought to add. But, and please hear me out here, I don’t want any interruptions now, perhaps, isn’t it just barely possible that, well, its, and don’t mistake my meaning here, many things I am but pretentious is certainly not one of them! Perhaps You, well, that is to say, perhaps in my specific case, not that I am much different than the others, but You know I have certainly tried to distingui- anyway, as I was saying, perhaps for me it is different? Maybe, this feature would actually improve the overall design?” 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Designer smiles, and shakes His head. He makes the short journey over to the bookcase again, this time selects a brown folder from the second shelf down, and returns to the table, the man still focused on comparing the miniature blueprints on the table to his own masterpiece. While the Designer searches for a particular file, the man suddenly smiles, completely delighted in himself. He glances over at the Designer and smirks, determined to let Him say His piece, but also ecstatic that he himself will have the final word. “Perhaps this Designer is not quite as adept as my friends realize.” The man thinks smugly, his face betraying his thoughts. “It is a good thing I am His customer now- I will be able to set Him straight in private, before one of His customers sees His flaw and brings Him before a court or defames Him to others. No no, not I. I will help this poor Man, and when He sees what I have seen, He will gladly concede that perhaps I am a bit wiser and world-worn than any of His previous clientele. And maybe He will ask me my opinion next time. Oh what?” These last words aloud, the man is broken free of his reverie by the Designer beckoning Him to look at a few more of the miniaturized prints. 
            </p>

            <p>
                “Oh I see I- oh I see!” The man exclaims excitedly, his triumph only moments earlier all but forgotten. “Ah yes, oh how beautiful! Oh so You do use these features in other people’s plans, oh how nice! Yes, so just like this, exactly where you put it on this man’s plans- I’m glad we are seeing each-others point of view a little better now!” The Designer shakes His head, and holds up a thin black cylinder. An ink pen, one with a precise point and the kind of ink that dries immediately and will not smudge, no matter how hard or how soon you press on it. He then again produces the six prints with the familiar names on them. Indeed, the man recognizes, everyone of the lines on the paper were obviously produced by this pen. The lines were straight, bold, and completely unsmudged. And of course, he begins to recall, he had seen the same ink used on the Older Plans, which now lay buried somewhere on the table, underneath the mess of other plans and purposes. “Well that certainly is a nice pen but-” then he begins to understand. On the three miniature plans, the ones the Designer had most recently produced, this ink was present as well- however, it was not alone. Accompanying it were lines colored pea-green, brown, pink, some had been smudged by a careless writer, others were completely crooked, and didn’t match up to others. Then, a small box at the bottom left corner of the prints stands out to the man. He has not noticed it before, perhaps, because on all the other prints it had been the same- nothing noticeable, just a standard part of the prints, like leaves on a tree or sand on a beach- something he had not noticed because it just belonged there. The box was stamped on to the paper with dark-red ink, and in it, the name of the Designer had been written, of course, in the same ink as was produced by the pen which now sat in the Designer’s pocket. Why he notices it now, is because on these last three prints it is different. On the first the red box is still there, but the name had been scribbled out, and another printed, this time in the green ink. On the second page, the box was particularly hard to make out, mainly because the name had not only been crossed out and replaced, but so had the one that replaced it, and the one that replaced that one, making each name completely illegible and resulting in a disgusting combination of writing styles and colors, which made for an almost rainbow, if rainbows were principally formed of the colors most often found in trash heaps and garbage dumps. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The third one interested him the most though, because instead of random colors and shapes, the ink used in this one was almost identical to the one produced by the pen of the designer, and the lines were straight enough. However, although he could not put his finger on it, there was something off in the color- almost like the one who mixed the ink had put in too much of this, or not enough of that, or perhaps forgotten or added something else entirely. Most importantly though, what the man notices, is that the box contains the name of the Designer! But upon closer inspection, the name is not drawn perfectly- it must have been a forgery. If one were to just glance at it quickly, or someone were not familiar with His Signature, it could easily pass as from His shop. No, the difference that the man now realizes, the longer he stares, is actually very miniscule- The color of the box is not the same red. In fact, the color of the box is very nearly orange instead of red. The man can’t figure this out exactly. 
            </p>

            <p>“So these two” indicating the first two of the three plans “were originally Yours but they have been altered?” The Designer nods deeply and slowly. “And the third one- well it certainly looks good enough, but, I suppose since it is in this stack, it is not Yours either? Was it altered, or was it never yours?” The Designer indicates the latter with His gesture, and then the man notices something else in the eyes of the Designer. There is considerable sadness, and almost, no not possible, and yet “Are You in pain Sir?” The man asks, although he doesn’t have to. For the Designer is even now gingerly putting the three prints back into the folder, and returning them to the shelf, His eyes glistening with tears as He does. “And those names? I don’t recognize the names of the customers. And the other names, the ones in the designer’s box- other designers I suppose? Oh! That is business You have lost? Oh I am sorry, this is a cutthroat world and I am afraid. But this is exactly why I could use that feature! Think of it, it was on every other designer’s plans! If you would only let me include that and put Your name on it, You would never lose customers again, for Your work is certainly exemplary and with this small inclusion-” He trails off here, because the Designer returns to the table, with the same sad look in His eyes. Except now, it is a different sadness. It is a personal sadness. Not a sadness brought on from past memories, but a current, direct sadness, that the man could not help but feel he was the cause of. It was at this point that he decided to drop the whole idea of the feature entirely.</p>
        
            <p>
                The three plans in the brown folder returned to the bookcase, the Designer begins to gather up the six miniature plans and to place them into their respective folders. This action suddenly reminds the man of his realization from earlier, and although the sadness of the Designer has certainly deflated his “victory” he figures he had better mention it. “Sir?” The man questions holding up the final print still left on the table. Bill’s. “I see now, after you have shown me, that the feature I believe to be helpful to all parties involved and increasingly beneficial to You personally I might add, is simply not in Your repertoire and therefore I understand You leaving off adding it to the Plans- However, now I have noticed something and I thought I should bring it to Your attention. Look here. Bill’s plans, (oh they are so beautiful) well if You look over here to the left (my how talented the one who drew this must be) You notice that added here, is this minor particular, and well, I have noticed as I looked at the other plans (oh they are all so wonderful, how on earth did You think of- anyway) not one of them is missing it.” The Designer nods slowly. “Well, it seems such a fine addition, so fine in fact, that actually each one of these people has told me that it was their favorite part of the design! All six of them! And well, needless to say it was certainly one the reasons I came to You, and well, I don’t mean to be like this but it seems like this could come from other designers as well (I saw a similar particular on one or two of the other plans, I think it was the green ink or perhaps the pink- not that it matters of course) so I suppose, in a round-about way, my question is, well, and please take no offense, well- I suppose it is more of a statement, but, well the particular is nowhere on the Plans You showed me at first. The Ones all the way at the bottom of this pile.” The Designer smiles, takes the final plan, Bill’s, slides it back into the folder, and returns it to the shelf, all the while the man waits (I wont say patiently) for an answer, or an explanation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The man stands confused. He had expected earlier to see some surprise from the Designer at His leaving off such an attractive particular, one that He seemed to include in all of His plans. He had expected some thanks, and then a hurried addition of the particular (perhaps a better version than on the other plans) to the Original. Instead, the Designer simply returns carrying a notepad. He flips to a certain page, and shows it to the man, indicating the first entry at the top of a list of names. “Yes I already- yes I- well fine,  Sally”. The next line. “Laurie. But-” The next. “Dan. Alright, Stig, Maryanne, and yes, yes Bill. The same names as were on the prints. But-” and he noticed another, as the Designer’s finger points to the seventh entry. “Well- well yes, it does appear to be my name. Yes I see, it is all of my friends and I- and yes, I see they are all Your customers- well yes I supposed they were all very satisfied by Your work and- well of course, after all they sent me to You didn’t they?” It is then, as the Designer sweeps His hand across the entire list that the man begins to realize (or rather begins to admit he realizes) “Well. No. None of the names are the same. So does that mean. Does that mean, then. I am-” He hesitates. “I am different?”
            </p>

            <p>
                The pages have all been put away and the floor swept. The candle on the table next to the door burns low- the night has gotten on. The Designer uses His pen to cross off the day’s date on the dusty calendar hanging above the desk. And then, for only the second time tonight, He questions the man, indicating the following day on the calendar. The man hesitates, and looks at the blueprints that had been the focus of much of the night’s discussion as they rest in his palms. He looks longingly at the feature on the top right, and the missing particular to the left. The Designer looks at him, sighs, and holds out His hand. The man, unsure, offers Him the plans, but doesn't quite let go. The Designer guides the plans and his hand to the table. He pulls out His pen. Unsure, the man braces himself, ready to knock the pen away if He attempts to alter or ruin the plans. He writes, the man starts, and He looks over with knowingness. He finishes writing and lets the man see. Instead of adding or erasing anything, He has instead, drawn names and addresses, each producing arrows which point to either the feature, or the proposed location of the particular. The man realizes, with a hint of shame, that the names are those which obscured the Designer's on the three plans from the brown folder. The Designer rolls up the plans, and hands them to the man, who takes them slightly hesitantly. The Designer indicates the time, the crossed off date, and finally the door. He smiles at the man. Sadly, maybe even expectantly, but not disappointedly. 

            </p>

            <p>
                The man walks towards the door, clutching his masterpiece plans. He turns at last once he reaches the door. Looking back at the Designer, who’s gaze has never once wavered. After a few moments of silence and thought, as well as consideration of the bookcase which he sees over the shoulder of the Designer, the man walks slowly over to the calender and indicates the following day, confidently, but also questioningly. The Designer smiles, nods in agreement, and reaches out His hand once more. The man hesitates, considers, notices the warmth in the smile, and hands over his precious masterpiece. As he reaches the door once more, he looks guiltily back at the Designer. “If You are looking for somewhere to put that-” the Designers stops and looks up. “I noticed there was some space in the Brown folder.” The Designer smiles once again, turns, opens the aluminum trash can, and slides the blueprints into it, shutting the lid with an intentional clang. He points at the Original Masterpiece on the table. “There is plenty of space in the Tan folder as well.”
