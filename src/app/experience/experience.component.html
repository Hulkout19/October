                        Collaborated with a team to design and apply a machine learning model which used PANDAS in Python to read and analyze data and make predictions accordingly. This model used several machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Decision trees, and Multilayer Neural Networks. This project/paper was peer reviewed and accepted for publishing. I presented the project virtually at an International Conference held in Toronto, Canada.
