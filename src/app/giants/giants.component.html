                <i>For thus the Lord said to me:
                “Go, set a watchman,
                Let him declare
                What he sees.”
            </i>
            </p>


            <p>I have no grounds for if the Lord spoke that to me or not but I’d hate to pass on and find I’m locked out of Heaven for failing to tell about what I saw on May 2. First off, I saw Morgan. Morgan Pope was a square shouldered white man of 6’5, had to be in his late fifties, with bristles on his chin. Morgan changed his clothes like any other man, but often didn’t vary from the black boots, faded blue levis, and red flannel. He wore a shotgun too. People don’t typically wear weapons but he did, probably feel embarrassed if he walked out the house in the morning without it. It was always the same shotgun too, not because he felt any special attraction to that one, a side-by-side Stoeger from Brazil. Brazil probably isn’t even still there. But that side-by-side Stoeger from Brazil was about the only shotgun around that still fired a decent shot. So Morgan wore it. And Monday it was loaded. </p>

	<p>People respected Morgan. They couldn’t love him. Love goes two ways and Morgan seemed like he had none of that left. But they respected him. He had kept Phoenix Ctr safe and led them for five years now. He had kept them protected, fed, and about as civil as anyone can be nowadays. Morgan didn’t talk much. His vocabulary didn’t include many words, and he certainly wasn’t eloquent with the ones he used. That’s not completely fair to say. No one was eloquent at this point in time. No one is eloquent when they are the handle to the only door in front of two-hundred stragglers. And at this very moment, Morgan was. Jesse wasn’t the handle. I’d call him the hand. Jesse was eloquent.</p>
    
	<p>Jesse was a giant. I don’t know if it matters to what I am recording where the giants came from. I hope not. I hope the Lord doesn’t mind that I don’t include that detail. Because I certainly don’t know and at the judgment seat I will plead ignorance. Probably what made them so monstrous was the cloud of mystery. They didn’t just “show up.” They didn’t just spring out of the ground. It was more like one day we tried looking back and seeing where they came from and we couldn’t because we couldn’t even imagine a time without them. Jesse wasn’t their leader, he just spoke eloquently. When he spoke, it was like singing. His voice didn’t make your blood curdle. It made it ripple.</p>

	<p>He wasn’t actually singing. I don’t want anyone reading Jesse’s words and singing them in their head or out loud to their loved ones or saying “how could he sing that, that doesn’t rhyme!” The answer is that no one sings. Not like they used to. People still write songs, they still say them fast, or slow, they still put on concerts, people still cry when they hear them. But it isn’t singing, not like anyone over eighty would remember. I knew an eighty year old man once. We sat in Phoenix Ctr together while the children put on a new “song” they had written. Everyone too young clapped and stamped along. I can’t blame them, I did too. There were a few younger older people who had at least heard stories about real singing. They knew this was a farce, but they couldn’t mention that and ruin everyone’s fun, so they wiped their tears, and smiled away. This man was old enough to have heard real songs. </p>
<p>He wasn’t a nice man. He caught my eye and pulled my ear over to his mouth, from which came the words “real singing would hang himself if he heard this!” I suppose he knew enough about this person “real singing,” or maybe that was the name he called himself. Either way, he was right. We woke up the next morning to find that “Real Singing” had taken a string off the five string guitar (now a four string) and had somehow managed to use it as the upward force he needed. Gravity provided the downward force. What “Real Singing” said to me I repeated to no one in Phoenix Ctr. He had ruined it for me, because now I cried at their callings and screamings too. But I let them enjoy because they knew no better. And I knew worse. So Jesse didn’t sing. But he sure spoke eloquently.</p>

<p>We were standing between two mountains. There was about a half a mile between where the ground slopes up for each one. If there was a line from slope to slope it would’ve had a slight curve to it. But there was no line, because no one had drawn one. It was on the east side of this line that nobody drew where the stragglers had set up their town. Phoenix Ctr. It wasn’t where the actual Phoenix was. It could’ve been. No one knew where the actual Phoenix was. But we knew we were still in Arizona. And Phoenix was the only Arizona city anyone remembered. So our town was Phoenix Ctr. The sky was a burnt orange, like a sunset. But it was probably somewhere around 3 in the afternoon. It was dry and very hot, but there was a warm breeze which somehow cooled the world a bit. They hadn’t been invited. To be fair neither had we. But they were here. We were too. </p>

<p>Like I said, Jesse was a giant. And at this moment, he was a giant in front of about thirty other giants. Jesse stood about ten and a half feet tall. And he was a big one. He was speaking eloquently at the moment. And he never looked at Morgan. </p>

<p><i>“Hello there old stragglers! Valiantly you have scrounged for food and bowed for drink. To live this long is an accomplishment worthy of celebration! So we are here to celebrate with you! Let us take a moment and just breath together!” </i></p>

<p>He breathed deeply. We breathed, but quickly. </p>

<p><i>“Are we not one of the same? We are but survivors on this earth!”</i></p>

<p>Morgan spoke. “You kill us!” Now Jesse looked at him. When he turned, he sort of whipped his neck to make eye contact with him. He was waiting for him to speak, but he wouldn’t look until he did. Looking validates existence. Jesse wouldn’t do that. Not for Morgan.</p>

<p><i>“Morgan? We survive together, but not all of us! Some of us survive over others. Some of us survive because of others. Some of us-” </i></p>
<p>Here Jesse broke eye contact to look at the old traffic light in Phoenix ctr, one hundred feet beyond.</p>
<p><i>Some of us don’t survive at all.” </i></p>
<p>Real Singing had hung from that light. So had Morgan’s father. Morgan didn’t flinch. But he unslung his shotgun. </p>
<p>
    Jesse groaned. It was exaggerated, like an old door opening one more time than it wanted to. 
    
</p>
<p><i>
    “A gun Morgan? A gun? You know I’ve tasted death’s little spawn before and spat them out again.” 
    </i>
</p>
<p>

    With this he motioned to his forehead. It was pocked with tiny craters, like someone made the impressions with their thumb. Bullet holes. People had shot Jesse before. Morgan’s father had shot Jesse before. Morgan’s father was dead. Jesse spoke eloquently.
    
</p>
<p>
    Those pockmarks were irrelevant to everyone there. Everyone knew guns don’t bite giants. They nip them. But they certainly don’t bite them. Sometimes you could nip them, and they would get annoyed. Sometimes they got distracted. Then you could run. That was the only reason anyone carried guns. That’s not why Morgan carried one. I don’t know why he did, but that wasn’t why. Morgan doesn’t run. 
    
</p>
<p><i>
    “I have been shot. Your father shot me. What was his name? I haven’t walked along the hills in nearly a month, along the rivers in two. Excuse my poor memory, but I haven’t been through Keller’s in three.” 
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    Jesse must have expected some reaction, because he paused here for a beat. Fool. Morgan never reacted to anything. I had watched him bury his father. In Keller’s Cemetery. No reaction then. No reaction now. Jesse didn’t react now. 
    
</p>
<p>
    <i>“He carried a gun like that too! Not the same one surely. I took that one and I broke it! I know he didn’t have it when he swung. He would’ve used it. Enough about the past now Morgan, and enough about those who did not survive! Not like us. We survived. We survive.”</i>
    
</p>
<p>
    Morgan spoke. But not eloquently. “Look at us! Look at them!” Here he motioned with a sweep of his big, cracked hand to the stragglers behind him. “They are the ones who have survived by living! We survive in spite of you. You survive on us. You and your blood-chugging kind! You haven’t stepped in Keller’s because Keller’s is behind us, and I am in front of you!” At this Jesse laughed. He threw back his head and laughed, his short-cropped hair blowing above his forehead. His laugh was similar to his voice. Like fake singing.
    
</p>
<p>

   <i> “Morgan, not all of your woes come at my hand! Don’t blame me for your sons and your daughters! They may have been attacked, but they were not defended! And I have come to remedy such woes. I have come to walk through Keller’s. My lips are dry and cracked. Come and walk with me Morgan. You can be my guide to the soft furrows and to the tender grass.”</i>
    
</p>
<p>

    Morgan’s face didn’t change. But its hardness seemed to become more resolved. Like concrete settling. “You are not welcome in Keller’s, and you are not welcome in Phoenix.” It felt like Morgan breathed this at first, as if convincing himself. He said it again. Actually he yelled it. “You are not welcome in Keller’s, and you are not welcome in Phoenix.” Jesse smirked. He was waiting for this.
    
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I have heard those words before Morgan. Your father said them to me, and your grandfather too. He stood there just like you, both of them did. Your father carried a gun- yes I am now sure that the one you are holding must be the same. It nipped me five times. See here, on my forehead? This pit here, above my collar bone. And twice here on my arm. I suppose the fifth is here, on the palm of my hand. That one I felt the heat. Every nip he fell back a little, every step I took he matched. And I walked through Keller’s that day. He swung that day too. I knew he would, so I cupped my hand and dug a little trough for him. Not a full grave, but you know, just something to help the diggers along.”</i>
    
</p>
<p>

    Morgan stood for a while. All were silent. Some remembered the day Jesse spoke about. I didn’t. But Real Singing had. Probably where he got the idea to swing. “This ain’t my father’s gun, Jesse.” He reached his hand behind his back. “I redone that one.” He pulled out a metal rod, about five feet along. It was mangled, and not perfectly straight. Made from the barrel’s of several shotguns, all mangled together. Light from the dying day glistened off of tiny inscriptions carved along the sides of it. I don’t know what it said. They say that Morgan had taken a pick and carved out the names of every relative he could remember. Others said it was the name of Jesse and his family. But what do they know. They weren't there. I was there. And I know what he did with it.  It even stopped Jesse. 
    
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Ah yes, the gun I grabbed. Look there, I see my fingerprint! I see the place I grabbed as I ripped it from your father’s hand-”</i> Here Jesse stopped, because Morgan was moving. He did not run west, towards Jesse, as other fools had done before. He did not turn around and run east, towards Phoenix, as most had done in the past and were getting ready to do now. He placed his shotgun on the ground. He ran South. Nearly 400 yards he ran, to where the ground began sloping up towards South Peak. There, he railed up and stabbed the gun-stick into the ground. It didn’t make a significant impact, but enough that it cleared away a small depthless crater. Morgan looked up, towards the North slope. He made his mark. Then he dragged the stick. For nearly 800 yards he dragged the stick, as we and they breathlessly watched. All was silent. If you had stared at Jesse’s face the whole time you would’ve seen conflict. Every few moments it worked its way into a knot that seemed like it would unwind into an eloquent attack on Morgan. But then it would unwind again, silently. For over an hour Morgan dragged that stick, until he had reached the North slope. Then he walked the nearly 400 yards back to where his gun still lay, and he picked it up.
    
</p>
<p>
    “This ain’t my father’s gun, Jesse. I redone that one. For as long as anyone still  pumping blood can remember, you and your blood-chugging kind have been walking through here, walking through our cemeteries and getting your fill. The rest of this world has gone to hell. It’s burning around us and I can’t do anything about that. I ain’t got the strength to hunt you down and ‘radicate your kind so I ain’t gonna try. You want to walk through the cemeteries of the oceans and the mountains and whatever other crap is still out there, that’s fine, I ain’t gonna stop you. I couldn’t if I wanted to. There was time for that a long time ago but whatever time was there just ain’t around anymore. But you don’t come any further. You see this here line? I’m ashamed to say that I ain’t never seen one like it in all the days I’ve been out here. My father never drew it, nor anyone else. This here is my line and it’s as far as you go. Walk wherever you want to until you dry outta blood or your legs fall off. But you stop at this line. This far you can come and you come no farther. I don’t care if you come and hang yourself next to this line. But you stop at this line. This far you can come and you come no farther”
    
</p>
<p>
    Morgan didn’t cry. His voice didn’t even break. It was rough, but that was normal. His mouth was straight and firm. But that was normal. His eyes narrowed, but that was normal. Jesse took a step forward. Morgan didn’t move. That wasn’t normal. Everyone moves.
    
</p>
<p>
    Here Jesse laughed again, but not like fake singing. Like it was actually fake. <i>“Your father told me the same thing, Morgan! He stood there just like you, Morgan!”</i> As he spoke, he got less eloquent, and more angry. He smiled less. <i>“You are no different than him Morgan! I stepped past him and I will step past you!”</i> He stopped smiling. He took another step forward. Morgan took no step in any direction.
    
</p>
<p>
    “This far you can come and you come no farther, Jesse! This far you can come and no farther!”
    
</p>
<p>
    <i>“I may not remember his name, but I remember his blood, Morgan! It tasted like his father’s, and his! That’s the thing with families Morgan! Their blood always tastes the same! I’ve tasted his and it was sweet! His father’s was sweet and your son’s was sweet! I have thirsted for more, and I will taste it again Morgan! I will taste yours, Morgan!” </i> Jesse took another step forward, and then another. Ten feet from the line that Morgan drew. Morgan took no step in any direction.
    
</p>
<p>
    “I have no idea what my father’s blood tasted like, and I have no idea what mine tastes like. But this far you can come and you come no farther. You hear me Jesse? This far you can come and you come no farther!”
    
</p>
<p>
    Morgan was never eloquent but his voice was a poem. <i>“This isn’t a decision you can make Morgan!” </i> was shouting now. <i>“I make the decisions, and I will walk through Keller’s today! I walked and he swung, your father. I will walk, and you will swing!”</i> Spit from his lips and another step forward. Five feet now. <i>“Better load your gun, Morgan.” </i> I smirked at this. That gun must’ve been loaded for days by now.
    
</p>
<p>
    “The chamber is full Jesse. The line is drawn. This far you can come and you come no farther. You hear me? This far you can come and you come no farther!”
    
</p>
<p>
    Jesse took another step. One more and he would cross the line. <i>“You better have some special bullets in there Morgan because I've been nipped before. And you know what? It actually made the blood taste sweeter when I got to it. When giants drink blood, people say the blood mingles with their own, and they become more and more like the people they’ve drunk. You know what that means, Morgan? I’ve got your father’s blood in my brain. I’m looking at you with his eyes. I’m thinking his thoughts. He isn’t proud of you Morgan. He thinks you look like a fool standing there with a little nipper that isn’t gonna do more than dent my forehead, and even that is one in ten.”</i> He inched forward a little. His boot toes a hair off of the line.
    
</p>
<p>
    “If that is my father’s blood in there or not, it doesn’t matter to me. He ain’t proud of me, and I ain’t proud of him. He stood there and didn’t draw no line. He stepped back and matched your pace. He shot but that ain’t enough. He didn’t stand like a man, and at the end of the day, he swung like a criminal. I don’t know if he’s thinking in there with you. But if he is, tell him I drew this line. Tell him that I said this far you can come and you come no farther.”
    
</p>
<p>
    Jesse stepped forward. A foot raised on one side of the line Morgan drew, and fell on the other side of the line that Morgan drew. The line that wasn’t meant to be crossed. Jesse’s face was aflame. He seemed to be reveling in his victory. But Morgan shot him in the face. I had once seen a plane fall out of the sky. It fell nose down, through clouds and smoke, until it struck the ground with such force that we felt it from miles away. I thought that nothing would stop it, not even the ground. Morgan’s round was like that.
    
</p>
<p>
    No one ever really knew what was different this time. What made it strange was that many had seen it before, with Morgan’s father. He had planted his feet. Morgan did too. He had taken aim as Jesse walked. Morgan did too. He had shot him, square in the face. Morgan did too. He hadn’t killed him though. Morgan did. Morgan killed that giant that day. The bullets he used were the same. He stood in roughly the same place. They say that it may have been because he was standing firm. His father was walking backwards. Morgan hadn’t moved, didn’t even look like he felt the recoil. Like all the momentum had nowhere to go but straight through Jesse’s skull. But I don’t know who they are, and they weren’t there that day. I was. And I know why it happened. It happened because Morgan stood there, stepped up, and made that bullet go through that giant’s face.
    
</p>
<p>
    There was a stunned silence. We were stunned, they were stunned. Morgan wasn’t stunned. He had already decided that bullet was gonna go through. Jesse wasn’t stunned. Jesse was dead. The air smelled like smoke. Morgan hadn’t moved. Jesse had moved. Jesse had crumpled. The sun (we were pretty sure it was the sun) had sunk to the horizon. If Morgan’s father did have his blood swishing around in Jesse’s head, it certainly wasn’t in there anymore. It was stretched out for about three yards straight west. Morgan exhaled slowly. Tired. But not stunned. He looked first at all the stragglers to the east, and then towards the giants to the west. He didn’t speak eloquently.
    
</p>
<p>
    “Y’all knew Jesse? Y’all spoke to him before? I know he spoke real pretty all the time. I don’t know if you considered him your leader or not. But I can’t talk like him! I don’t talk real nice I just say the words I think make my point. For too long, longer than I’m proud to say, you and your kind have watched us, waiting for a new swinger. Then, once they are cold and buried like you want you come march over to our cemeteries and into our homes and you get your fill. And maybe that’s what Jesse taught you to do. Maybe Jesse taught you that that is your right. And maybe you believed him. But he’s dead and I ain’t. Maybe you do have a right to the rest of the world, who am I to say? But you stay west of this line. I don’t care if you go and dig up a hundred grave yards. But not Keller’s. Maybe nippers didn’t mean nothing to you in the past. But you step across this line and I will shoot you, and I will kill you. Phoenix Ctr is off-limits, and you are not welcome. You step across and all we have to do is start diggin’ bigger graves. Jesse’s dead, and I did that. You walk wherever you want to. But you see this line? This far you can come and you come no farther.”
    
</p>
<p>
    Morgan waited a beat before he slung his shotgun and started walking back towards Phoenix Ctr. I ran to catch up with him and walk him back. He never turned around once, never to check if any one crossed. He knew they wouldn’t. And they didn’t. Later they would ask me what happened. There must be some explanation! A silver bullet in the barrel, some kind of lore banning giants from lines, maybe a threat sent beforehand. They couldn’t believe what happened. But I don’t care. I don’t know who they are, and they were not there that day. I was. And I know exactly what happened. Morgan carried a gun no different from the one his father did. He walked the same steps and stood in the same place. He didn’t speak eloquently and he didn’t even know what a song was. The line he drew wasn’t even straight. But he drew a line. For a long time people had faced them down and threatened them. But they never stopped, and people had always retreated. Morgan knew they wouldn’t cross his line because he decided they wouldn’t. I think all the giant-targeted towns in the world are all the same in the long run. They don’t need more firepower or better warriors. They don’t need better defenses. All they need is someone who is willing to draw a line and say “no farther.”
